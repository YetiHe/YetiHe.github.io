I am Yetao He, a Chinese student from Guangzhou, China. I am actively seeking 2026 Fall PhD positions.

I expect to earn my Master's degree in 2026 from the Department of Biomedical Engineering at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), Baltimore, United States. I am co-advised by Dr. Ji Yi ([Yi Lab](https://www.yilab.org/)) on laser scanning systems, and Dr. Yu Sun ([Hopkins Computational Imaging Group](https://hcig.wse.jhu.edu/)) on generative models. At this stage, I am focused on the high-throughput laser scanning microscopy, and the integration of advanced computational models and optical imaging pipelines.

Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in 2024 from the Department of Biomedical Engineering at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), Shenzhen, China. I was advised by Dr. Jianbo Tang ([Bio-Optic and Acoustic Technology Lab](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/tangjianbo.html)) on ultrasound imaging and optical coherence tomography. During this time, I was involved in ultrasound speckle decorrelation-based velocimetry and dynamic light scattering-OCT based quantitative imaging. 

My research interests include optical imaging, computational imaging, and ultrasound imaging.
